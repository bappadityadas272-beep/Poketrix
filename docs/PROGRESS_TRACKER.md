Tests: 68 passing (35 schemas + 33 dex). `ruff check src tests` is clean.

## Phase 0 — scaffold (`cp-00`)

- `pyproject.toml`, `src/` layout, pytest and ruff configuration.
- Checkpoint workflow in `docs/CHECKPOINTS.md`: one branch per task, merge `--no-ff` and tag
  `cp-NN` only after human review.

## Phase 1 — schemas (`cp-01`)

`src/poketrix/schemas/`, 35 tests.

- `enums.py`: generations, types, categories, stats, statuses, weathers, side conditions.
- `generation.py`: `GenRules` / `rules_for(gen)`, the single place for per-generation rules.
- `pokemon.py`: `Species`, `Move`, `StatSpread`, `PokemonSet`, `BattlePokemon`, `to_id()`.
- `battle.py`: `GameState`, `SideState`, `FieldState`, `ActionRequest`.
- `outputs.py`: `DamageRange`, `KOChance`, `MathReport`, `SetPosterior`, `ActionPrediction`,
  `SubsystemResult[T]`, `Recommendation` (the LLM guardrail).

## Phase 2 — dex data layer (approved 2026-10-10)

Branch `task/02-dex-data`, merged into `main` as `cp-02`.

What was built:

- `scripts/build_dex.mjs` (+ `scripts/package.json`, `package-lock.json`): exports the snapshot
  from `@pkmn/dex` 0.10.11. Rebuild with `cd scripts && npm install && npm run build-dex`.
  Node is build-time only.
- `data/dex/gen{1..4}/{species,moves}.json` and `data/dex/manifest.json`: committed snapshot,
  about 413 KB, so tests run offline.

  | Gen | Species records | Distinct dex numbers | Moves |
  |-----|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
  | 1 | 151 | 151 | 165 |
  | 2 | 251 | 251 | 267 |
  | 3 | 392 | 386 | 370 |
  | 4 | 530 | 493 | 483 |

- `src/poketrix/dex/snapshot.py`: cached loader; validates every record against the schemas and
  rejects duplicate ids and missing files.
- `src/poketrix/dex/dex.py`: `Dex(gen)` with `species()`, `move()`, `all_species()`,
  `all_moves()`; `UnknownDexEntryError` (a `KeyError`) for unknown ids; `ValueError` for
  unsupported generations.
- `tests/test_dex.py`: 33 tests covering all acceptance criteria from `CLAUDE.md`.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` updated; `node_modules/` added to `.gitignore`.

Decisions taken with the user:

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Data source | `@pkmn/dex` (Showdown data) |
| Alternate formes | Included, sharing the base dex number |
| Learnsets | Deferred |
| Gen 1 Bide type | Stored as Normal, not Showdown's `???` |

Calls made during the build (confirmed at review, see below):

- Typed Hidden Powers are keyed by their own ids (`hiddenpowerfire`, …) because Showdown gives
  all 16 the shared id `hiddenpower`. They carry Showdown's 70 base power; the real type and
  power from IVs is left to the Math layer.
- Abilities are empty in Gens 1–2 and limited to abilities that exist in that generation from
  Gen 3 (Showdown lists modern abilities in every generation).

## Review of Task 02 (2026-10-10, reviewer: Claude in claude.ai, on behalf of the user)

Verdict: **APPROVED.** 68/68 tests pass on the user's machine. Spot checks on the snapshot:

- Gen 1 type quirks are correct: Bite, Gust and Karate Chop are Normal-type, and Blizzard has 90% accuracy.
- Hidden Power exists only from Gen 2. Before Gen 4 its category follows its type (HP Bug and HP Fighting are physical); in Gen 4 it is always special.
- Abilities are limited to each generation. Gen 3 and Gen 4 Gengar only have Levitate, and Gen 3 Blaziken only has Blaze.
- Formes are present: Deoxys ×4, Rotom ×6 and Giratina-Origin.

Open calls, now **confirmed**:

1. **Typed Hidden Powers** (`hiddenpowerfire` and so on) at 70 base power. This also matches how Showdown's Random Battle
   set pools name them, which helps Task 04. Condition: the Math layer derives Hidden Power's type and power
   from IVs when they are known, falls back to 70 only when they aren't, and never computes damage for the
   untyped `hiddenpower` placeholder (Normal-type, 0 base power).
2. **Abilities limited per generation** from Gen 3, and empty in Gens 1–2.

Findings to carry forward. None of them block the merge.

- **F1: fixed-damage moves.** The snapshot stores base power 1 for moves like Seismic Toss, which is Showdown's convention.
  Seismic Toss, Night Shade, Dragon Rage, Sonic Boom, Super Fang, Psywave, Bide, Counter, Mirror Coat, Endeavor and
  OHKO moves must **not** go through the damage formula. `Move` needs a field that marks this.
  That's a schema change, so Task 03 has to propose it.
- **F2: Gen 1 Bide is stored as Normal**, as decided. Because it deals fixed damage (F1), it ignores the
  type chart in the Math layer, so a Ghost-type isn't immune to it. Add a test.
- **F3:** `.claude/settings.local.json` is per-machine Claude Code configuration. Add it to `.gitignore` and don't commit it.
- **F4:** this tracker file is untracked. Commit it with the merge, because it is the logbook.

## Orders for Claude Code (do these in order, stopping where marked)

### Order 1: close Task 02 (no stop needed, the user has approved)
1. On `task/02-dex-data`, add `.claude/settings.local.json` to `.gitignore` and commit this tracker and the
   `CLAUDE.md` pointer change.
2. Run `git switch main`, then `git merge --no-ff task/02-dex-data`, then `git tag -a cp-02 -m "Dex data layer, Gens 1-4"`.
3. Add cp-02 to `docs/CHECKPOINTS.md` (68 tests) and mark phase 2 as done in `README.md`.
4. Run `pytest` and `ruff check src tests` on `main`, then `git push origin main --tags`.
5. Report the push result in one line.

**Result (2026-10-10): done.** Merge commit `7621b89`, tag `cp-02`, 68 tests green and ruff clean on
`main`, pushed (`5cf9c2d..7621b89 main -> main`, new tag `cp-02`). GitHub reported that the repository
moved to `bappadityadas272-beep/Poketrix` (capital P); the old URL still redirects.

### Order 2: Task 03 design proposal, Math layer, Gen 4 first. **STOP after the proposal.**
Branch: `task/03-math-gen4`. Write the proposal as a new section in this tracker, not as a new file.
It must cover:

- **Package name:** `poketrix.calc`. Don't use `poketrix.math`, because it reads as the standard library's `math`.
- **Type chart per generation:** `effectiveness(gen, move_type, defender_types) -> float`.
  - Gen 1 has quirks: Ghost does 0× to Psychic, Bug and Poison are 2× against each other, and Ice is 1× against Fire.
  - Gens 2–4 use the 17-type chart, in which Steel resists Ghost and Dark.
- **Stat formula:** Gens 3–4 use IVs, EVs and natures. Gens 1–2 use DVs and Stat Exp. Include the 25-nature table.
- **Gen 4 damage formula with an exact roll list (16 rolls).** Keep the integer rounding and the order the modifiers apply in exactly as the games do; that's
  where hand-written calculators usually go wrong. Split it into two stages:
  - **03a:** the core formula, STAB, type effectiveness, critical hits (2×, ignoring stat drops and screens), burn, Reflect and Light Screen, and weather.
  - **03b:** common items and abilities (Choice Band/Specs, Life Orb, Expert Belt, Technician, Adaptability, Huge Power,
    Levitate, Thick Fat, Flash Fire). It can be a separate checkpoint.
- **Fixed-damage path (F1):** propose the schema change and how it's handled, for example a
  `fixed_damage: Literal["level", "half_hp", ...] | int | None` field on `Move`, rebuilt into the snapshot.
- **Exact KO odds:** over 16 rolls × crit chance (1/16 at stage 0 in Gens 2–4) × accuracy, with
  n-hit KO chances by convolving the roll distribution, giving `KOChance(method="exact")`. Monte Carlo is kept for
  cases with secondary effects or across several turns, and is not part of 03a.
- **Verification oracle:** generate golden test cases at build time with **`@smogon/calc`**, the engine behind
  Showdown's damage calculator. Use Node in `scripts/`, the same pattern as `build_dex`, and write the cases to
  `tests/fixtures/calc_golden_gen4.json`, at least 30 of them, including crits, burn, screens, weather, STAB and immunities.
  The Python calculator must match every roll list exactly. Propose how the cases are chosen.
- **Latency target:** a 4-move × 6-matchup report computes in under 5 ms. Include a small timing test.
- **Out of scope for Task 03:** Gens 1–3 (they become Task 03c after Gen 4 is checked), Hidden Power derived from IVs beyond
  a helper function, doubles, and multi-turn effects.

Then **stop** and ask the user to approve or adjust the proposal before writing any calculator code.

## Task 03 design proposal — Math layer, Gen 4 first (2026-10-10, awaiting approval)

Branch `task/03-math-gen4`. No calculator code exists yet. The formula below was read from the
source of `@smogon/calc` 0.12.0 (`mechanics/gen4.js`), the oracle we have to match.

### Corrections to the review findings

- **F1 is narrower than stated.** Base power 1 appears only in the **Gen 1** snapshot (Counter, Dragon
  Rage, Night Shade, Psywave, Seismic Toss, Sonic Boom, Super Fang). Gens 2–4 store 0 for these.
  The schema change is still needed, because nothing marks *how* they deal damage.
- **Fixed damage still respects type immunity in Gen 4.** The oracle checks immunity before the
  fixed-damage path, so Seismic Toss does 0 to a Ghost-type. F2 (Bide ignoring the type chart) is a
  Gen 1 rule and belongs to Task 03c; the fixed-damage design below carries a per-move flag for it.

### Package layout: `poketrix.calc`

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `typechart.py` | `effectiveness(gen, move_type, defender_types) -> float` |
| `stats.py` | Stat formulas (Gens 3–4 now), nature table, stat-stage multipliers |
| `hidden_power.py` | `hidden_power(gen, ivs) -> (type, power)` helper |
| `engine.py` | `DamageEngine` protocol and `engine_for(gen)` registry |
| `gen4.py` | Gen 4 engine: variable roll damage and fixed damage |
| `ko.py` | Exact n-hit KO odds from a per-hit damage distribution |
| `report.py` | Builds `MoveEvaluation` / `MathReport`, wrapped in `SubsystemResult` |

One engine class per generation behind one protocol, so Gens 3 → 1 are added in 03c without
touching the Gen 4 code. Engines work on plain integers internally and build Pydantic models once
at the boundary, which is what keeps the latency target reachable.

**Inputs reuse existing schemas; no new input types.** An engine takes
`(attacker: BattlePokemon, defender: BattlePokemon, move: Move, field: FieldState,
defender_conditions)`. Both Pokémon must carry a `known_set` (stats come from it). For the opponent,
Task 04 will supply a copy with `known_set` filled from a set hypothesis.

### Type chart

- Data, not code: export each generation's chart from `@pkmn/dex` to
  `data/dex/gen{N}/typechart.json` with the existing build script, validated at load.
- `effectiveness` multiplies the per-type factors. The Gen 4 engine applies the two defender types
  as **separate floored steps**, ordered by the canonical type order (Normal, Fire, Water, …,
  Steel), as the oracle does; that order changes results by 1 HP in some 4× and ½×2 cases.
- Acceptance checks: Gen 1 Ghost → Psychic 0×, Bug ↔ Poison 2×, Ice → Fire 1×; Gens 2–4 Steel
  resists Ghost and Dark; `???` (Curse, Struggle) is neutral against everything.

### Stat formula

- Gens 3–4: `HP = floor((2B + IV + floor(EV/4)) × L / 100) + L + 10`;
  other stats `floor((floor((2B + IV + floor(EV/4)) × L / 100) + 5) × nature)`, nature as 110/100/90
  in integer arithmetic. Shedinja's HP is 1.
- Gens 1–2 (DVs, Stat Exp) are written in 03c, but `stats.py` is split by `rules_for(gen)` so the
  slot exists.
- The 25-nature table is exported from `@pkmn/dex` to `data/dex/natures.json`, not typed by hand.
- Stat stages: `floor(stat × (2 + n) / 2)` for boosts, `floor(stat × 2 / (2 − n))` for drops.
- Missing IVs default to 31 and missing EVs to 0 (the convention already documented on `StatSpread`).

### Gen 4 damage formula (exact order, all steps floored)

1. Base power (03b adds power modifiers here, each floored: Technician, type-boosting items,
   Thick Fat, pinch abilities).
2. Attack: raw stat, then stage. **A critical hit ignores negative attacker stages.** (03b: Huge
   Power, Guts, Hustle, Choice Band/Specs, and similar.)
3. Defense: raw stat, then stage. **A critical hit ignores positive defender stages.** Sandstorm
   gives Rock-types ×1.5 Special Defense; Explosion and Self-Destruct halve Defense; minimum 1.
4. `base = floor(floor(floor(2L/5 + 2) × power × A / 50) / D)`
5. Burn: `floor(base × 0.5)` for physical moves.
6. Reflect / Light Screen: `floor(base × 0.5)`, skipped on a critical hit.
7. Weather: sun/rain `floor(× 1.5)` or `floor(× 0.5)` on Fire/Water; Solar Beam halved in rain,
   sand and hail.
8. (03b: Flash Fire boost.) Then `base += 2`.
9. Critical hit: `× 2`. (03b: Sniper ×3, then Life Orb `floor(× 1.3)`.)
10. For each roll `r` in 85…100: `floor(base × r / 100)`, then `floor(× STAB)`, `floor(× type1)`,
    `floor(× type2)`, (03b: Filter/Solid Rock, Expert Belt, Tinted Lens, resist berries), then
    `max(1, …)`.
11. An immune matchup returns the single roll `[0]`.

Non-integer multipliers (1.3, 1.2, 1.1) use the same double-precision operations as the oracle, so
results match bit for bit.

**Stage split**

- **03a (cp-03a):** steps 1–11 without items and abilities, plus fixed damage, exact KO odds, the
  type chart, stats, the golden fixtures and the timing test.
- **03b (cp-03b):** items and abilities listed in the orders, plus crit-stage modifiers, multi-hit
  moves and weight-based moves.

### Fixed-damage path (F1) — proposed schema change

Showdown only has *data* for three cases (`damage: 40`, `damage: 'level'`, `ohko`). Super Fang,
Psywave, Endeavor, Counter, Mirror Coat, Metal Burst and Bide are code callbacks there, so the build
script needs a small explicit id table for them.

New optional field on `Move`:

```python
fixed_damage: int | FixedDamage | None = None

class FixedDamage(str, Enum):
    LEVEL = "level"              # Seismic Toss, Night Shade
    HALF_TARGET_HP = "half_hp"   # Super Fang: max(1, floor(current HP / 2))
    PSYWAVE = "psywave"          # level × (50…150)/100, a roll list of its own
    TARGET_TO_USER_HP = "endeavor"
    OHKO = "ohko"                # target's current HP, if it lands
    REACTIVE = "reactive"        # Counter, Mirror Coat, Metal Burst, Bide: depends on damage taken
```

- An `int` is a flat amount (Sonic Boom 20, Dragon Rage 40).
- Validator: `fixed_damage` set ⇒ `base_power == 0` and the move is not a status move. The build
  script therefore writes 0 instead of Showdown's Gen 1 placeholder 1.
- `REACTIVE` moves cannot be evaluated before the turn, so they produce no damage estimate.
- A second new field, `ignores_type_chart: bool = False`, is set for Gen 1 Bide (F2) and used in 03c.
- Type immunity is checked before fixed damage in Gen 4, as in the oracle.
- The snapshot is rebuilt and the dex tests extended for these fields.

Two further `Move` fields are needed for correct numbers and are proposed with the same rebuild:
`crit_ratio: int = 1` (high-crit moves such as Stone Edge, for KO odds) and
`multihit: tuple[int, int] | None` (03b).

### Moves whose power is not a constant

20-odd Gen 4 moves have base power 0 or a conditional power (Return, Gyro Ball, Low Kick, Grass
Knot, Flail, Reversal, Eruption, Water Spout, Punishment, Fling, Natural Gift, Magnitude, …).

- 03a implements the ones that need only data we already hold: Return/Frustration (102, maximum
  happiness assumed, as the oracle does), Gyro Ball, Eruption/Water Spout, Flail/Reversal, Brine,
  Facade, Wake-Up Slap, Crush Grip/Wring Out, Punishment.
- The rest wait for 03b (they need species weight or item data).
- A move the engine cannot evaluate must be reported as *unsupported*, never as a guessed number.
  That needs one new optional field, `MoveEvaluation.unsupported_reason: str | None`.

### Exact KO odds

- Per-hit distribution = miss (`1 − accuracy`, damage 0) + non-crit (uniform over 16 rolls) + crit
  (uniform over the 16 crit rolls).
- Crit chance by stage in Gen 4: 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2; `crit_ratio` picks the stage in 03a.
- Accuracy = move accuracy × accuracy/evasion stage multiplier; `None` accuracy never misses.
- n-hit KO for n = 1…4: convolve the distribution n times over integer counts with a common
  denominator, then `P(total ≥ defender's current HP)`. The result is `KOChance(method="exact")`.
- Stated assumptions: no healing, residual damage, hazards or switching between hits. Those are
  Monte Carlo territory and stay out of 03a.
- Verified by brute-force enumeration in tests, because the oracle's own KO text ignores crits and
  accuracy and so cannot be the reference here.

### Hidden Power

- `hidden_power(gen, ivs)` implements the Gens 3–4 type and power (30–70) formula.
- The engine derives type and power when the attacker's set lists all six IVs; otherwise a typed
  entry (`hiddenpowerfire`) is used at 70; the untyped `hiddenpower` placeholder is unsupported.

### Verification oracle

- `scripts/build_calc_golden.mjs` with `@smogon/calc` pinned at 0.12.0 (MIT, build-time only, added
  to `scripts/package.json`) writes `tests/fixtures/calc_golden_gen4.json`.
- Each case stores the full input (species, level, nature, IVs, EVs, stages, status, current HP,
  move, weather, screens), the oracle's computed stats, and its 16 non-crit and 16 crit rolls.
- **Case selection, proposed:** about 40 hand-picked cases, each tagged with the mechanic it
  targets, plus about 200 seeded-random matchups restricted to 03a mechanics.
  - Hand-picked coverage: neutral, STAB, 2×, 4×, ½, ¼, immunity, dual types in both orders, crit
    with boosted and dropped stages, burn, each screen, screens with crit, sun, rain, sandstorm
    with a Rock-type, Explosion, level 1 and level 100 extremes, minimum-damage 1, every fixed-damage
    kind, each variable-power move in 03a, Hidden Power.
  - The random sweep is what catches rounding-order bugs; the seed is fixed so the file is stable.
- The Python engine must reproduce every stat and every roll list exactly. 03b adds its own tagged
  cases to the same file.

### Latency

- Target: a 4-move × 6-matchup report (24 evaluations with KO odds) in under 5 ms.
- A timing test asserts the median over repeated runs, with headroom so it is not flaky on a busy
  machine. Computed stats are cached per set.

### Out of scope for Task 03a/03b

Gens 1–3 (Task 03c), doubles, multi-turn effects, Monte Carlo, and building a `MathReport` straight
from a `GameState` for the opponent (needs Task 04's set hypotheses).

### Decisions needed before any code

| # | Question | Recommendation |
|---|----------|----------------|
| Q1 | Type chart and natures: export from `@pkmn/dex`, or type the tables by hand in Python? | Export (one source of truth, no transcription errors) |
| Q2 | Accept the `Move` changes: `fixed_damage`, `ignores_type_chart`, `crit_ratio`, `multihit`, and base power 0 for fixed-damage moves in Gen 1? | Accept |
| Q3 | Accept `MoveEvaluation.unsupported_reason` so unsupported moves are reported, not guessed? | Accept |
| Q4 | Golden cases: 40 hand-picked + 200 seeded-random (about 150 KB committed), or hand-picked only? | Both |
| Q5 | Move the **immunity abilities** (Levitate, Flash Fire, Water Absorb, Volt Absorb, Motor Drive, Dry Skin, Wonder Guard) from 03b into 03a? Without them 03a reports Earthquake damage on Gengar, Rotom and Bronzong. | Move into 03a |
| Q6 | Add `@smogon/calc` 0.12.0 as a build-time dependency in `scripts/`? | Yes |
| Q7 | Update the git remote to the new URL `…/Poketrix.git` reported by GitHub? | Yes |

## Standing rules

- Avoid new documentation; update existing files first.
- No secrets in the repo.
- Ask before decisions; recommendations are welcome.
- Keep the code simple and direct; follow SOLID.
- Stop after every step for review; never commit directly to `main`.
