Tests: 68 passing (35 schemas + 33 dex). `ruff check src tests` is clean.

## Phase 0 — scaffold (`cp-00`)

- `pyproject.toml`, `src/` layout, pytest and ruff configuration.
- Checkpoint workflow in `docs/CHECKPOINTS.md`: one branch per task, merge `--no-ff` and tag
  `cp-NN` only after human review.

## Phase 1 — schemas (`cp-01`)

`src/poketrix/schemas/`, 35 tests.

- `enums.py`: generations, types, categories, stats, statuses, weathers, side conditions.
- `generation.py`: `GenRules` / `rules_for(gen)`, the single place for per-generation rules.
- `pokemon.py`: `Species`, `Move`, `StatSpread`, `PokemonSet`, `BattlePokemon`, `to_id()`.
- `battle.py`: `GameState`, `SideState`, `FieldState`, `ActionRequest`.
- `outputs.py`: `DamageRange`, `KOChance`, `MathReport`, `SetPosterior`, `ActionPrediction`,
  `SubsystemResult[T]`, `Recommendation` (the LLM guardrail).

## Phase 2 — dex data layer (approved 2026-10-10)

Branch `task/02-dex-data`, merged into `main` as `cp-02`.

What was built:

- `scripts/build_dex.mjs` (+ `scripts/package.json`, `package-lock.json`): exports the snapshot
  from `@pkmn/dex` 0.10.11. Rebuild with `cd scripts && npm install && npm run build-dex`.
  Node is build-time only.
- `data/dex/gen{1..4}/{species,moves}.json` and `data/dex/manifest.json`: committed snapshot,
  about 413 KB, so tests run offline.

  | Gen | Species records | Distinct dex numbers | Moves |
  |-----|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
  | 1 | 151 | 151 | 165 |
  | 2 | 251 | 251 | 267 |
  | 3 | 392 | 386 | 370 |
  | 4 | 530 | 493 | 483 |

- `src/poketrix/dex/snapshot.py`: cached loader; validates every record against the schemas and
  rejects duplicate ids and missing files.
- `src/poketrix/dex/dex.py`: `Dex(gen)` with `species()`, `move()`, `all_species()`,
  `all_moves()`; `UnknownDexEntryError` (a `KeyError`) for unknown ids; `ValueError` for
  unsupported generations.
- `tests/test_dex.py`: 33 tests covering all acceptance criteria from `CLAUDE.md`.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` updated; `node_modules/` added to `.gitignore`.

Decisions taken with the user:

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Data source | `@pkmn/dex` (Showdown data) |
| Alternate formes | Included, sharing the base dex number |
| Learnsets | Deferred |
| Gen 1 Bide type | Stored as Normal, not Showdown's `???` |

Calls made during the build (confirmed at review, see below):

- Typed Hidden Powers are keyed by their own ids (`hiddenpowerfire`, …) because Showdown gives
  all 16 the shared id `hiddenpower`. They carry Showdown's 70 base power; the real type and
  power from IVs is left to the Math layer.
- Abilities are empty in Gens 1–2 and limited to abilities that exist in that generation from
  Gen 3 (Showdown lists modern abilities in every generation).

## Review of Task 02 (2026-10-10, reviewer: Claude in claude.ai, on behalf of the user)

Verdict: **APPROVED.** 68/68 tests pass on the user's machine. Spot checks on the snapshot:

- Gen 1 type quirks are correct: Bite, Gust and Karate Chop are Normal-type, and Blizzard has 90% accuracy.
- Hidden Power exists only from Gen 2. Before Gen 4 its category follows its type (HP Bug and HP Fighting are physical); in Gen 4 it is always special.
- Abilities are limited to each generation. Gen 3 and Gen 4 Gengar only have Levitate, and Gen 3 Blaziken only has Blaze.
- Formes are present: Deoxys ×4, Rotom ×6 and Giratina-Origin.

Open calls, now **confirmed**:

1. **Typed Hidden Powers** (`hiddenpowerfire` and so on) at 70 base power. This also matches how Showdown's Random Battle
   set pools name them, which helps Task 04. Condition: the Math layer derives Hidden Power's type and power
   from IVs when they are known, falls back to 70 only when they aren't, and never computes damage for the
   untyped `hiddenpower` placeholder (Normal-type, 0 base power).
2. **Abilities limited per generation** from Gen 3, and empty in Gens 1–2.

Findings to carry forward. None of them block the merge.

- **F1: fixed-damage moves.** The snapshot stores base power 1 for moves like Seismic Toss, which is Showdown's convention.
  Seismic Toss, Night Shade, Dragon Rage, Sonic Boom, Super Fang, Psywave, Bide, Counter, Mirror Coat, Endeavor and
  OHKO moves must **not** go through the damage formula. `Move` needs a field that marks this.
  That's a schema change, so Task 03 has to propose it.
- **F2: Gen 1 Bide is stored as Normal**, as decided. Because it deals fixed damage (F1), it ignores the
  type chart in the Math layer, so a Ghost-type isn't immune to it. Add a test.
- **F3:** `.claude/settings.local.json` is per-machine Claude Code configuration. Add it to `.gitignore` and don't commit it.
- **F4:** this tracker file is untracked. Commit it with the merge, because it is the logbook.

## Orders for Claude Code (do these in order, stopping where marked)

### Order 1: close Task 02 (no stop needed, the user has approved)
1. On `task/02-dex-data`, add `.claude/settings.local.json` to `.gitignore` and commit this tracker and the
   `CLAUDE.md` pointer change.
2. Run `git switch main`, then `git merge --no-ff task/02-dex-data`, then `git tag -a cp-02 -m "Dex data layer, Gens 1-4"`.
3. Add cp-02 to `docs/CHECKPOINTS.md` (68 tests) and mark phase 2 as done in `README.md`.
4. Run `pytest` and `ruff check src tests` on `main`, then `git push origin main --tags`.
5. Report the push result in one line.

### Order 2: Task 03 design proposal, Math layer, Gen 4 first. **STOP after the proposal.**
Branch: `task/03-math-gen4`. Write the proposal as a new section in this tracker, not as a new file.
It must cover:

- **Package name:** `poketrix.calc`. Don't use `poketrix.math`, because it reads as the standard library's `math`.
- **Type chart per generation:** `effectiveness(gen, move_type, defender_types) -> float`.
  - Gen 1 has quirks: Ghost does 0× to Psychic, Bug and Poison are 2× against each other, and Ice is 1× against Fire.
  - Gens 2–4 use the 17-type chart, in which Steel resists Ghost and Dark.
- **Stat formula:** Gens 3–4 use IVs, EVs and natures. Gens 1–2 use DVs and Stat Exp. Include the 25-nature table.
- **Gen 4 damage formula with an exact roll list (16 rolls).** Keep the integer rounding and the order the modifiers apply in exactly as the games do; that's
  where hand-written calculators usually go wrong. Split it into two stages:
  - **03a:** the core formula, STAB, type effectiveness, critical hits (2×, ignoring stat drops and screens), burn, Reflect and Light Screen, and weather.
  - **03b:** common items and abilities (Choice Band/Specs, Life Orb, Expert Belt, Technician, Adaptability, Huge Power,
    Levitate, Thick Fat, Flash Fire). It can be a separate checkpoint.
- **Fixed-damage path (F1):** propose the schema change and how it's handled, for example a
  `fixed_damage: Literal["level", "half_hp", ...] | int | None` field on `Move`, rebuilt into the snapshot.
- **Exact KO odds:** over 16 rolls × crit chance (1/16 at stage 0 in Gens 2–4) × accuracy, with
  n-hit KO chances by convolving the roll distribution, giving `KOChance(method="exact")`. Monte Carlo is kept for
  cases with secondary effects or across several turns, and is not part of 03a.
- **Verification oracle:** generate golden test cases at build time with **`@smogon/calc`**, the engine behind
  Showdown's damage calculator. Use Node in `scripts/`, the same pattern as `build_dex`, and write the cases to
  `tests/fixtures/calc_golden_gen4.json`, at least 30 of them, including crits, burn, screens, weather, STAB and immunities.
  The Python calculator must match every roll list exactly. Propose how the cases are chosen.
- **Latency target:** a 4-move × 6-matchup report computes in under 5 ms. Include a small timing test.
- **Out of scope for Task 03:** Gens 1–3 (they become Task 03c after Gen 4 is checked), Hidden Power derived from IVs beyond
  a helper function, doubles, and multi-turn effects.

Then **stop** and ask the user to approve or adjust the proposal before writing any calculator code.

## Standing rules

- Avoid new documentation; update existing files first.
- No secrets in the repo.
- Ask before decisions; recommendations are welcome.
- Keep the code simple and direct; follow SOLID.
- Stop after every step for review; never commit directly to `main`.
